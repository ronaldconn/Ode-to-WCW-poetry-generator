## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

Utilizing a poetry database api as well as a photo database api, I created a simple motivation tool to bolster mood and creativity on off-days. The JS script pulls data at random from each database and renders them in the browswer. There are several hundred different poems and images so a repeat display is very unlikely. In honor of my favorite poet, [William Carlos Williams](https://poets.org/poet/william-carlos-williams).

## Optimizations

Ideally this app would have a more streamlined GUI. As it is, it works to get you a poem and a "feeling" quickly. I plan to add animateions and possible nature videos with sound to increase the ambiance.

## Lessons Learned:

This app challenges me to manipulate text with varying line breaks. Not every poem has the same length, structure, or layout. Therefore, the script had to be able to parse the poetry line by line at times in order to render it successfully on the page. This was of major importance to me because I did not want to change any of the peoms original layout as form arguable is extremley important to poetry. It was a fun puzzle nonetheless. I hope you enjoy my app. :)
